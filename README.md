The final goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly, dynamic web application to revitalise the hospitality industry. FirstResort is a platform that will enhance the hospitality industry and connect employers (Hosts) and employees (Candidates) on a global level. FirstResort will work on a two-user basis: Hosts and Candidates. Hosts are the owners/managers/recruiters for a hospitality establishment. For example, bars, restaurants, hostels, and hotels. Candidates are the Hospitality industry workers such as baristas, chefs, waiters, waitresses, ma√Ætre ds and barpersons will be able to register to FirstResort creating their profile, previous working experience, and certifications. As of now, there is no platform solely for hospitality and tourism.
